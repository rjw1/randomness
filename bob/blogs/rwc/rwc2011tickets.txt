On the 1st of July I got confirmation that my application for tickets for the rugby world cup in New Zealand was successful. I have tickets for all the England games, all pool games in Christchurch, the Christchurch quarter finals and the bronze final. Tickets for the semis and the final are by ballot nearer the time. 

Now that I have the match tickets its time to start planning the rest of the trip. My dad has probably already found us accommodation near Christchurch for the duration of the tournament. All I need to start looking for is round the world plane tickets. I intend to make a tour of it. If nothing else I have plans to be at the [Reno Worldcon](http://www.renovationsf.org/).
