<p>So somehow England have made it to the final. South Africa have looked good all tournament. This wont be the beating we got in the pool matches but I still think were going to lose. It will be close though. I think South Africa by&nbsp; 5. </p>
<p>Although ideally our forwards step up again and we win by 3 points or so. :)</p>
