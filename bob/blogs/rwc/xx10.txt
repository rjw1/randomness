<p>Just got off the ferry at Boulounge speeding to Paris in the car. We managed to get 2 tickets off a kiwi in London for a not to inflated price. We need a third but were not to fussed. One of us will go and watch it at the eiffel tower. <br/>Dad even managed to find a hotel about 2.5k from stade de france. So its all good. Now to pray for rain.</p>
