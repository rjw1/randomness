<p>Instead of taking the eurostar from London to Lille then tgv to Marseille im starting my travels from Utrecht.  So first a train to Schipol, then a plane to Clermont-Ferrand then a plane to Marseille. Then a camper van to Arles. Since we couldnt find any decent hotels in Marseille. So we will be taking trains from Arles to Marseille for the matches this weekend. </p>
