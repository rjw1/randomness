<p>Caught the last 20 minutes of this game in a bar full of french supporters. France looked awesome. Obviously the loss to Argentina was the kick in the arse they needed. <br/><br/>Missed the start since I was having a really nice dinner. Post to follow about that.<br/><br/>Yet to find hordes of England supporters. Perhaps they are all turning up tommorrow.</p>
