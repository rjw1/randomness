<p>Ive not had a chance to watch any matches this week. Work sent me to Utrecht. The dutch dont seem to show rugby matches in their bars. Ive not even been able to keep up with the cricket.  So I've had nothing to blog about.<br/><br/>I have a post in my head about the first weekend and the interesting things which happened but work and real life keep on getting in the way of writing it. </p>
