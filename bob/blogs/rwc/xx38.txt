Title: London to Nantes
Date: 09/21/2007 04:13:42 PM

<p>Currently sitting on a TGV between Paris and Nantes. Its really quite full. I was lucky on the eurostar as I got 2 seats to myself. The connection across Paris was a bit close. It is probably worth prebuying your Metro tickets at the eurostar terminal in london and knowing which metro line you want. In this case line 4 "the pink one" between Gare du Nord and Montparnasse. The walk from the tube to the train is quite long.<br/>Hopefully i can find somewhere to watch tonights crunch match between France and Ireland. I suspect France will win.</p>
