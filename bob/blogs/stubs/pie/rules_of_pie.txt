Here are the rules for deciding if the thing before you is a pie. 

1. Pies are entirely encased in pastry.
2. The pastry should have been at least two distinct pieces before cooking.
3. The pastry on top of a pie is allowed to have holes in it.

Rule 1 is the most important rule. If it is not entirely encased in pastry it can not be a pie. Therefore imposters such as Shepherd's Pie, Cottage Pie and Lemon Meringue Pie are not pie!

Rule 2 allows us to distinguish baked goods like Cornish Pasties and Sausage Rolls from pies. Since they are made from just one piece of pastry. In some cases it may be hard to tell. 

Rule 3 allows for fancier presentation of pies and for venting. This means pastry lattice work is an acceptable way to cover your pie.
