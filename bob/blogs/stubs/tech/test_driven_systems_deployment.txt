test deploys. while puppet and nagios should be testign stuff they may not catch everything. think of it as a deployment checklist.

things to test.
exim set up
these users should be present.
there shoudl be this number of users
these disks.
these paratiotions
total parations
packages. total number. spefici ones.
ports open, ports not open
ips. spefici total. is bonding used. check mac addresses. for devices.
test it has munin and nagios checks(total number)
xinetd.
check general configs such as resolv.conf. ssh set up. hosts file. 

anything puppet does should have a corrresponding test. most things tested shoudl become soemthign puppet does. apart form when you dont trust it.

for CI could be run as a nagios test through nrpe  once a day. or more often. with a genric pas or fail. then can be run more usefully locally.
