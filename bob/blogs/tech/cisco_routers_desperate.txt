<p>If you dont know much about using and setting up cisco routers I humbly suggest you buy <a href="http://nostarch.com/frameset.php?startat=cisco">Cisco Routers for the Desperate</a>. It was very useful this week when I set up a pair of 2811s with HSRP. I would tell you how but I think you should buy the book instead.</p>
