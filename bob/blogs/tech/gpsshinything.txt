<p>So recently <a href="http://london.randomness.org.u
k/wiki.cgi?Kake">Kake</a> and <a href="http://london.randomnes
s.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Bob">I</a> have been adding <a href="http://

using a Garmin Etrex she has been borrowing from a friend. However, it
possibly has one of the one most annoying interfaces i've used for a
while and we only have one.</p>
<p>So, I succumbed and bought the <a href="http://europe.nokia
.com/accessorieslink?s=LD-3W">Nokia LD-3W</a> which works with my <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20
070429141420/http://europe.nokia.com/A4142101">phone</a>.
I can get location data with applications which came as standard and
indeed save landmarks which I can then export as an xml file. I cant
get any routes though. However, I did find an <a href="http://
research.nokia.com/research/projects/SportsTracker/">application</a> from nokia research which almost gi
ves me what i want. It can export trip data as kml. So for your viewing pleasure <a href="http://web.arc

hopgoo.kml">My trip to the butchers</a> this morning. It jumps around quite a bit. </p>
<p>One problem is that I can only get Lat/Long out when we are using OSGB for the guide. Thankfully, the
 windows <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gp
s/osnetfreeservices/furtherinfo/questsoftware.html">program</a> the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/

ive.org/web/20070429141420/http://gps.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/convert.asp">convert</a> between them can run
 under <a href="http://www.winehq.com/">Wine</a>. This will ma
ke mass conversions easier. </p>
