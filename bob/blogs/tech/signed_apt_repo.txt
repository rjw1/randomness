Title: Setting up a Signed apt repo

Date: 07 August 2009
<p>So you've set up a apt repository following dean's excellant <a href="http://blog.unixdaemon.net/cgi-bin/blosxom.pl/operatingsystems/linux/debian/personal_apt_repo_initial.html">instructions</a> and youve tried to install a package and got the following warning</p>
<pre>WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!</pre>
<p>At this point you have several choices:-
<ul>
<li>press yes and carry on.(not that useful if youre using puppet to install stuff)</li>
<li><code>echo "APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated 1;" >> /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99unauth</code></li>
<li> Set up a <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt">secure repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Lets go with setting up a secure repository.
<ul>
<li>Make yourself a gpg key - <code>gpg --gen-key</code></li>
<li>Export your public key to a file - <code>gpg --armor --export $keyid >public.key</code>. You will need this later</li>
<li>Create an apt-release.conf containing <code>APT::FTPArchive::Release::Suite "etch";</code><small>(Im behind and should have written this post a year ago)</small> in your repository base.</li>
<li>Generate a release file - <code>apt-ftparchive -c apt-release.conf release dists/etch/ > dists/etch/Release</code></li>
<li>Create a signed version - <code>gpg --sign -ba -o dists/etch/Release.gpg dists/etch/Release</code></li>
</ul>
Your repository is now secure. Now you need to tell your machines about your key or apt-get will emit <pre>W: GPG error: http://debianrepo etch Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY $KEYID</pre>. To do this manually you can take the public.key you generated earlier and copy it to your machines and then run <code>apt-key add public.key</code></p>
<p>
Of course in this day and age doing things like that for all your machines would be tedious so I use <a href="http://reductivelabs.com/products/puppet/">puppet</a> with a class something like the following.</p>
<pre>
class aptkey {

  file { "/etc/apt/public.key":
    mode   => 440,
    owner  => root,
    group  => root,
    source => [
        "puppet://puppet/host/public.key",
        "puppet://puppet/files/public.key"
        ],
  }
  exec { "install-key":
     command => "/usr/bin/apt-key add /etc/apt/public.key",
     require => File["/etc/apt/public.key"],
     unless  => "/usr/bin/apt-key list | /bin/grep -q 'firstname.lastname'";
  }
  exec { "key-update":
     command => "/usr/bin/apt-get update",
     require => Exec["install-key"],
  }
}
</pre>
